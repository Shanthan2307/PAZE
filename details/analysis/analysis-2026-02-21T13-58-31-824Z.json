    "description": "1) Detailed Description:\nThe image depicts a city street scene. The foreground shows a section of sidewalk made up of large concrete tiles. Some of the tiles appear to be damaged or lifted, creating uneven areas in the walkway. In the background, there is a busy city street with vehicles and pedestrians passing by. The buildings lining the street have a mix of commercial storefronts and residential units, with some colorful signage visible. The overall scene conveys a sense of urban activity and a need for maintenance or repair of the sidewalk infrastructure.\n\n2) List of Objects:\n- Concrete tiles/slabs\n- Vehicles (cars, trucks)\n- Pedestrians\n- Streetlamps\n- Building facades\n- Signage\n\n3) Landmarks:\nThere are no clear landmarks visible in the image.
